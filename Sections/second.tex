I am currently a Junior at Skyview High Schoolâ€™s STEM magnet 
program with a specialization in computer programming. 
I have taken multiple Advanced Placement classes, including 
Computer Science A and Physics 1, which have assisted me 
in being able to improve my comprehension of complex topics. 
I am also a part of a video game research development group, 
where we spend various hours developing complex algorithms 
via a 3-Dimensional video game that will be presented to 
judges in May. My varying experiences in multiple STEM fields 
have prepared me to be an independent problem-solver.
