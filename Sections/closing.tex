%My continuous experience in robotics has allowed me 
%to develop a sincere interest in image recognition. 
%In my past two years as a programming lead in my 
%school’s FIRST Robotics team, I have worked closely
% with image recognition in order to optimize game
%  strategy with my peers. As a result, I have gained a curiosity in how 
%  computer vision works, and have conducted relevant independent research during my own free time.
%
%  I am confident that my STEM background alongside my strong 
%  knowledge of various fields of computing provides me with 
%  a strong foundation for this position. 

My continuous experience in robotics 
has allowed me to develop a sincere interest in image recognition. 
As a result, I have gained a curiousity in how computer vision works, 
and have conducted relevant independent research whenever I am free. 
I came across the topic of multi-modal learning with image recognition, and I 
instantly became intrigued. Multi-modal learning will allow me to optimize the robot 
quality using multiple modalities, such as distance sensors. Since this research 
topic is applicable to my passion for robotics, I hope to be able to expand 
upon this research topic through this program.
